      <description>Had a call about a possible adder attack on a family cat and the owner brought down the cat and also the adder. He was brought in a small detergent box. After carefully opening the box and tipping the snake into a large plastic container we realised we were dealing with a grass snake, most likely male. These snakes are non-venomous and do not constrict so they are absolutely harmless to people.</description>
