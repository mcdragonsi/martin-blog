Of course not literally, but it was published today in the local newspaper that the Freshwater West (the location of one of my recent trecks: The difference is in the Angle) will be used as a filming location for the upcoming movies Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Ridley Scott&amp;rsquo;s Robin Hood remake.
The debate is now mostly concerning whether the beach will still be opened to the public and when the road will be closed during the filming in May and June 2009.</description>
