      <description>Ever since I moved to Wales 2 years ago I had a quiet wish to climb the highest peak in this country - Snowdon. Last weekend was showing to be a perfect opportunity to fulfil that wish. I was working only till 12 pm and the forecast was for sunshine and high temperatures stretching way into the following week. Getting some good literature, so you know what your are doing, is very advisable.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1106&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;500&amp;rdquo;] Grim looking Pantmaenog forrest, or what is left of it[/caption]
It actually called Foel Cwmcerwyn and is the walk no. 20 in the book. There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been any proper rain for a couple of weeks so it looked promising. I had to abandon this walk weeks ago due to the fact that one big part of the walk was transformed into quite a substantial stream.
None of that this time, the sun was up, no sign of the before mentioned stream.</description>
