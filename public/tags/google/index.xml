      <description>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1558&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;500&amp;rdquo;] Taken from Google StreetView[/caption]
Google StreetView&amp;rsquo;s coverage has been extended to about 90% of the country and that now includes Haverfordwest and Pembrokeshire . The images are pretty high quality. I have heard there is a bit of an anomaly with the High Street in Pembroke Dock as part of it was filmed in once season and the other part in another, with Christmas decorations still visible.</description>

      <description>I have joined the hoard of internet users around the world and started using Facebook . I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it much but so far I am very impressed in the overall system. Really well thought out and programed. No wonder Google and Microsoft have appetites in the company. It is assumed to be worth around 10 billion USD . The company was founded by a student drop-off in 2004 and currently has 42 million active users and more than 14 million photos are uploaded daily to the site.</description>
