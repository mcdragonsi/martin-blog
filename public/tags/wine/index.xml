      <description>I had the opportunity to sample a great studio-grade professional foot pedal from a company called Line6. The machine is called a POD XT Live and was lent to me for a few days by a friend. On the website the POD XT Live is described as an »uncomplicated, gig-ready tone machine that&amp;rsquo;s portable and adaptable to different real world stage and recording environments«.
Well, it is truly impressive and quite complicated to a novice like myself.</description>
