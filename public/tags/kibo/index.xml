      <description>Friday, October 4th The descent from Kili was done very quickly. Not sure if the guides were worried I might not make it down but two of them grabbed me by my arms and almost carried me downhill. When we got back to the base camp at Kibo we were given about an hour to rest and have a warm meal. After that we had to pack all our stuff and head to Horombo.</description>

      <description>Thursday, 3 October Elevation: 5,895 m (Uhuru peak), alpine desert
This post was written months after I actually did the climb. There were so many emotions surrounding this day I needed time to process them. So as I procrastinated the post I ended just forgetting about it. Putting it to words and posting it onto this blog was of secondary importance to me. The thoughts and memories will be mine forever.</description>

      <description>Wednesday, 2 October Elevation: 4,703 m (Kibo Hut), alpine desert
Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was supposed to be 5h long to the Marangu route&amp;rsquo;s basecamp at Kibo hut. Somewhere along the 11 kilometres we hiked we left the marshland and entered what could be best described as rocky desert, a lunar landscape that has been plonked down on top of an African mountain.
This is also where some in the group started to feel the altitude problems.</description>
