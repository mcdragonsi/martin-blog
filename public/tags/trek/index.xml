Nice contrast from the Rosebush walk I took yesterday. This walk is no 40 called Pentre Evan Nature Reserve and I just a great forest walk with some hill climbing thrown in as well.
This was also the walk that was the most confusing as the instructions in the book didÂ not help in many parts of the woods. I got badly lost once and had to back-track quite a bit to get to the right path again.</description>
