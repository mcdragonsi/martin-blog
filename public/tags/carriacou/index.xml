      <description>The Chikungunya virus / Sun, Siyang et al., 2013&#xA;Soon after starting planning my volunteer trip to Carriacou I was given advice about vaccinations I would require. These were basically for rabies and tetanus. As I was tested and proven that I already had enough anti-bodies against tetanus (Clostridium tetani) all I had to do was to get my rabies shots. Great. Cashed out over Â£110 for this and thought this was it.</description>
