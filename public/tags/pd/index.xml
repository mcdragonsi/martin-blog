      <description>Now it seem to be all happening. I received the PD reserve 160 and the Cypres 2 Expert 1-pin AAD last week. I would expect the Cypres to come in a nice packet, which it did, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a clue how the parachute would be packed. Well, it literally came &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo;. I put it in a bag myself so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get stained or damaged - not that a plastic bag is any real protection.</description>
