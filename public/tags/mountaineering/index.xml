It actually called Foel Cwmcerwyn and is the walk no. 20 in the book. There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been any proper rain for a couple of weeks so it looked promising. I had to abandon this walk weeks ago due to the fact that one big part of the walk was transformed into quite a substantial stream.
None of that this time, the sun was up, no sign of the before mentioned stream.</description>
