      <description>Back here again, desperately trying to find an FS-1 coach to get my FS-1 license done. Only did one jump today as I developed one very nasty headache and it seems this is one of the rare times I didn&amp;rsquo;t bring any painkillers along.
Oh, what fun ;-)
Beside that the Friday night jumps will commence soon, preparations are under way as I speak (I mean write).

      <description>After waiting for 11 months and practically giving up on the notion of jumping out of a plane for the foreseeable future. The given opportunity came last week, Friday off and a sunny forecast. Great weekend.
Managed 7 jumps the Netheravon DZ. Now all I am left to do is to get my FS1 licence as its needed in the UK for jumping in groups.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t take any photos, was a bit worried would get nicked as the DZ is situated on an active military base (technically its an airfield camp ).</description>

      <description>My recent visit to the motherland gave me the opportunity for yet another skydiving session, I joined my instructor and mentor Ale≈° Debeljak from the Paranoia skydiving school.
All went well and on the third jump of the second day just as I exited the Cessna 206 I apparently managed to hook my rig on the side of the door which resulted in a nasty tear in my container on the reserve parachute flap.</description>

      <title>Skydive London for a day</title>

      <description>Last weekend I did what I wanted to do for a long while - to actually skydive in the UK. I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting it off for a long time, lately mostly due to the weather we have been having. Last weekend the weather was OK, no flu lingering in the background and no lameness in any of the legs :-) The Skydive London dropzone is situated about 3 hours drive away from Haverfordwest , adjacent to the town of Swindon .</description>

      <title>Reserve parachute and AAD</title>

      <description>Now it seem to be all happening. I received the PD reserve 160 and the Cypres 2 Expert 1-pin AAD last week. I would expect the Cypres to come in a nice packet, which it did, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a clue how the parachute would be packed. Well, it literally came &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo;. I put it in a bag myself so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get stained or damaged - not that a plastic bag is any real protection.</description>
