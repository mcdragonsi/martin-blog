      <description>This was one of the walks from the book I mentioned before. This was walk no. 31. The village of Llawhaden is very easy to find as it is signposted on the A40. The parking is just before the castle. The path soon starts to be quite nice once you leave the broad muddy track and enter the woodland paths. I made a slight variation of the path and used the south path that leads you to the Holgan farm.</description>
