      <description>Ooops no more. I have received my container back this morning via FedEx . The tracking itself proves why it sometimes makes sense to switch your courier service. As I mentioned in my previous post here and here , I chose DHL to send my container to the U.S. It has a good network here in the UK and since I sent it in November there is an even closer service location right here in Haverfordwest &amp;rsquo;s WH Smith shop.</description>

      <description>I have now managed to send off the container to the manufacturer Aerodyne in Florida . I have just driven back from Swansea where I send off the container through a DHL ServicePoint location in the Parc Tawe Staples shop. Great service, if you ask me, as you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay a high price to have your packed shipped and you also choose what boy its going to be sent in - the price of shipment depends on the size of the box, but with a upper weight limit.</description>
