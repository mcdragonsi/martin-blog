      <description>Ever since I moved to Wales 2 years ago I had a quiet wish to climb the highest peak in this country - Snowdon. Last weekend was showing to be a perfect opportunity to fulfil that wish. I was working only till 12 pm and the forecast was for sunshine and high temperatures stretching way into the following week. Getting some good literature , so you know what your are doing, is very advisable.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_639&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;500&amp;rdquo;]   The photo of Bristol Cathedral chosen for the fifth edition of the Schmap Bristol Guide[/caption]
I received a mail today from an on-line publisher of digital travel guides called Schmap that my photo of Bristol Cathedral was chosen to be included in the fifth edition of the Schmap Bristol Guide .
I received an e-mail a while ago saying that the photo was short-listed for it and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think my photos were good enough for somebody to publish them in a guide.</description>
