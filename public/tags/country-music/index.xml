What a great night. Never though I would like country &amp;amp; western music. Funny thing to hear it in the heart of Wales.
The guys played great and made a great atmosphere despite the hall not being completely full.
As a fellow guitarist I was impressed and did appreciate how quickly the vocalist and guitarist Woody recovered from a broken guitar string.
By the way, I thought the name of the band &amp;ldquo;Woody Pines&amp;rdquo; came from an association with the local North Carolina forests.</description>
