      <description>This was the longest of the walks in the book and a walk not to be reckoned with. It is long and by the end you just really want to see that lighthouse in the distance.
The authors say in the beginning of the walk »Although the longest of the walks in this book, there is nothing difficult about its undertaking« - Yeah right, either they (both authors) came home from this walk and their egos were to big to admit the agonizing pain in their muscles or they had themselves a post-hike LSD trip.</description>
