      <description>Fullers Falls - Sgwd y Pannwr&#xA;This hike is worth talking about as it takes you round some spectacular views in the Brecon Beacons.&#xA;When I did the hike round Cwm Gwesyn the guide books told us about waterfalls but you saw was actually very small - especially compared to the waterfalls seen on this hike between Ystradfellte and Pontneddfechan.&#xA;One of the highlights of the walk is the fact that you can walk under one of the waterfalls names Waterfall of the Snow.</description>

      <description>This is marked as the toughest walk in the Brecon Becons &amp;amp; South Wales book and it turned out to be living up to its name. The most difficult part was trying to not get lost on Bryn Rhudd at the same time as not loosing interest in the walk as well. The views on there are almost desert-like, nothing but dried grass and boggy moors. Even the sheep are sensible enough not to stray that far from the valleys.</description>
