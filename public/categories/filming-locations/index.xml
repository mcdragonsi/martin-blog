      <description>After seeing the filming of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Robin Hood on the Freshwater West beach, Third Star in Barafundle Bay we have again the film crews back in Pembrokeshire for the filming of Snow White and the Huntsman on my favourite beach Marloes Sands.
Filming should be around September 26th - 29th and should mainly involve filming of about 80 horses galloping towards a computer generated castle* on Gateholm island.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1244&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;500&amp;rdquo;]Second location at the south Freshwater West carpark[/caption]
Had the opportunity to have a walk from Angle to the Freshwater West beach and it looks the production team has a lot of logistics to deal with. They seem to have chosen two locations to pitch-up marquees, one is just of the turn from the road to Angle on B4320 and B4319. The second, you could say the main, location is right next to the beach at the southern carpark.</description>

Of course not literally, but it was published today in the local newspaper that the Freshwater West (the location of one of my recent trecks: The difference is in the Angle) will be used as a filming location for the upcoming movies Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Ridley Scott&amp;rsquo;s Robin Hood remake.
The debate is now mostly concerning whether the beach will still be opened to the public and when the road will be closed during the filming in May and June 2009.</description>

      <description>I have tried to visit this place before but the last time got a bit disappointed as there was the standard parking fee. Today was a very good time to see the place, sunny and not a lot of people on it. Oh yes, and the parking was free. By the way, I am all for conservation and good old cash goes a long way in conservation but ripping local of so that they can use the local nature is just wrong.</description>
