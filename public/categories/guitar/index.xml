      <description>The day was good, the sun was up and the road was clear, well just to Haverfordwest golf club, after that I got stuck behind the never-ending queue of cars driving 40mph on a 60mph road :-) I&amp;rsquo;m not bitter. Really I am not.
  My final destination was Cardiff and Bristol although the latter was more as an alternative as I could not find any good music shops there over the internet.</description>
