My name is Martin and I started this blog in about 2006. The **OK Go** post was my very first. It was on Google's platform Blogger. I then migrated to Wordpress on different service providers: Bluehost, Webhosting UK and OVH. I finally broke free of Worpdress and moved to a static website platform. The static files are hosted on Amazon S3 and the domain managed by Cloudflare.
