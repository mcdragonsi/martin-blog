My name is Martin and I started this blog in about 2006. The **OK Go** post was my very first. It was on Google's platform Blogger. I then migrated to Wordpress on different service providers: Bluehost, Webhosting UK and OVH. I finally broke free of Worpdress and moved to a static website platform. The static files are hosted on Amazon S3 and the domain managed by Cloudflare.

## Locuming
You might have been redirected here from my old locuming page Martin.vet
Unfortunately I have been forced to stop locuming in 2020. Partly because of COVID-19, partly because of the new HMRC rules in regards to IR-35 that made being a locum financially unviable.
