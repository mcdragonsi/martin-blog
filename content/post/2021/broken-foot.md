I have done a few things in my life and and a lot of them involving my feet: I've hiked for hundreds of miles round Pembrokeshire, jumped out of an airplane 146 times, hiked up Kilimanjaro and the worse injury I had was a sore heel.

But hell noooo, I have a lovely afternoon stroll on a gravel road and I go and break a foot. That's it, my first fractured bone in my life at 48. And not really doing anything.

I was a bit sore since I hiked that day in May but just thought I had tendinitis or periosteitis. But just couldn't get rid of the pain. Had a checkup with a orthopedic surgeon about a week later and he sais should heal in 6 to 8 weeks. Considering by then it happened almost 4 weeks ago should be at least a month before I should be ok to hike (maybe).
