Had been to Slovenia many many times since I moved to the UK aback in 2007 but mostly flying and mostly with easyJet. Drove here and back once in those years and that was only to do the inital move and then drive the car back as it was a Slovenian reg and a LH drive which didn't make sense plus made the insurance a bit tricky.

Due to all the COVID issues I decided to try my first biking trip to it. It was in a way safer as you avoided crowding in two planced and twice in airports. Plus it was more of an adventure than just boarding a plane. One thing I also wanted to do is ride round Slovenian roads which I so far never done. The roads there are stunning and much better quality than here in the UK, perhaps Wales getting very close. As any of us know there roads are just divine to ride on. 

This amazing video just emphasises how beatutiful Slovenia is.
