Haven't been on this little gem for a few years now. Some parts can be quite muddy but everything is repaid with the views of the enchanted forest that is the Tŷ Canol nature reserve. So amazing. The photos don't do it justice.

This walk was a modification of the Pentre Ifan walk from circular Pembrokeshire walks book by Dennis and Jan Kelsall. Only this time I extended it from the Pentre Ifan burial chamber towards the now confirmed site where the Stonehenge bluestones were sourced from. The location is called Rhos y felin and it sits next to the river Brynberian and surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery Pembrokeshire has to offer.
