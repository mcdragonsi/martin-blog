This is not a news story about a lady who was given a gift voucher to do a tandem jump. No, no, this actualy my mother, who is, by the way, also a three-time grandmother, who bought herself a skydiving course here, in Slovenia, and actually finished it the next year when she passed the skydiving exam and became a proper licensed skydiver.
This is no small matter even for the school itself, the school is called [Paranoia](https://solaparanoia.com/) and is part of the Šolt organization and is ran by Mr. Aleš Debeljak.
My mother started the course in the Autumn of 2005 and gradually got better and better at skydiving. She even caught the attention of the biggest Slovene Sunday newspaper Nedelo who published an about her. The picture seen in the linked webpage was taken at a boogie (boogie = sort of a skydiving event) at Slovenj Gradec where the conditions were very demanding as there were quite strong turbulent winds at the dropzone.

May she have many great and safe jumps.

## Update from 2020
She stopped skydiving sometime round 2009 or 2010
