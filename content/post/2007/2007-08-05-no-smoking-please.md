I see that Slovenia is quite behind the smoking ban that is in the process of being inforced across the EU. I arrived in Wales on the 7th of April 2007 and that was the weekend, [when the ban started here](https://www.smokingbanwales.co.uk/). There was no big deal, however we will see what will happen in a few months time when the temperature drops. The ban was enforced just before the summer and it was followed by a very warm period. Many smokers took refuge in having a smoke outside bars and pubs. The ban was [first imposed in Scotland](https://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/) a couple of weeks earlier and much later in [England](https://www.smokefreeengland.co.uk/) in August 2007.

Since the ban I have had the privilege to visit a pub and not come out stinking as an ashtray. And what I saw on the Slovene [TV Dnevnik](https://www.rtvslo.si/dnevnik/) today was absolutely absurd, having a smoking evening with everybody lighting up and above all the ventilation was turned off. Mad!
