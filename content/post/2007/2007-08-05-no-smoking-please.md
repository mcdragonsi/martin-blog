[![The No Smoking sign, designed by one of the me...](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/No_Smoking.svg/202px-No_Smoking.svg.png)](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:No_Smoking.svg)I see that [Slovenia](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.05,14.5&spn=10.0,10.0&q=46.05,14.5&t=h) is quite behind the smoking ban that is in the process of being inforced across [the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union). I arrived in Wales on the 7th of April and that was the weekend, [when the ban started here](http://www.smokingbanwales.co.uk/). There was no big deal, however we will see what will happen in a few months time when the temperature drops. The ban was enforced just before the summer and it was followed by a very warm period. Many smokers took refuge in having a smoke outside bars and pubs. The ban was [first imposed in Scotland](http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/) a couple of weeks earlier and much later in [England](http://www.smokefreeengland.co.uk/) in August 2007.

Since the ban I have had the privilege to visit a pub and not come out stinking as an ashtray. And what I saw on the Slovene [TV Dnevnik](http://www.rtvslo.si/dnevnik/) today was absolutely absurd, having a smoking evening with everybody lighting up and above all the ventilation was turned off. Mad!
