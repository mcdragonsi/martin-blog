Closer I got to starting to work at the [vet clinic](https://www.fentonvets.co.uk/), the more I dreaded the moment and the more I felt not being up for the job seeing that I haven't practised vet medicine for so long. The first day of worked showed me, how much I great team of co-workers can help, when you are not sure of your own abilities to get the job done.  
  
I was afraid about performing operations as I had little experience from before, but I actually did so much on the first day and I didn't have the feeling I was doing something I wasn't really supposed so.
