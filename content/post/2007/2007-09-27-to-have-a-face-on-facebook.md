I have joined the hoard of internet users around the world and started using [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/). I haven't used it much but so far I am very impressed in the overall system. Really well thought out and programed. No wonder [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/) have appetites in the company. It is assumed to be worth around 10 billion USD (according to an article on Slashdot. The company was founded by a student drop-off in 2004 and currently has 42 million active users and more than 14 million photos are uploaded daily to the site.
So far I only found two friends: my former landlord from the houseshare in Hill mountain in Wales and [Debbie](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=562225924&highlight), who is an experienced skydiver that used to work as a [veterinary nurse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_technician) at the [Fenton Veterinary clinic](https://www.fentonvets.co.uk/) - the clinic where I now work.

You can try it out yourself. Visit [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/)
