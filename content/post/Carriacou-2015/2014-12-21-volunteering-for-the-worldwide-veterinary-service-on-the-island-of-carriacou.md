After months of preparation I will finally been taking a trip to the Caribbean island of [Carriacou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriacou) to do a few weeks of volunteer work for the [Carriacou Animal Hospital](http://www.carriacouanimalclinic.com/) ([Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/CarriacouAnimalHospital/timeline)). The trip was coordinated in conjunction with the [WVS](http://www.wvs.org.uk/) (Worldwide Veterinary Service) who has offered me loads of support and guidance.

I have put over Â£1,000 towards the trip but the CAH, WVS and I are also looking for any charitable donations of veterinary medical supplies. Get in contact with WVS here: [/www.wvs.org.uk/how-to-help/donate/](http://www.wvs.org.uk/how-to-help/donate/)

I have also created a JustGiving page where you can donate

![carriacou-map](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2014/12/carriacou-map-1.jpg)The island has about half the population of [Haverfordwest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverfordwest) - the town in Wales where I currently live. The 8,000 inhabitants that live on the island that could fit into [Pembrokeshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire) about 18 times are known to be very pleasant. Carriacou is renown to be the safest and the friendliest island in the Caribbean. Not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that they are big fans of rum and they have apparently over 100 rum shops.

The CAH, ran by Kathy, Shurlene and Hans, is very active in the welfare of pets on Carriacou and performs a lot of neutering and spaying as well as everyday animal healthcare services. I will hopefully be reporting to you on how it all goes when I get there. And getting there from good ol' [Pembrokeshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire) will not be that straightforward. First I will have to drive to Gatwick (near London), stay over there as the flight is an early morning one. Then there is the flight to Grenada but it first stops in St Lucia, all the time I will have to bear in mind that I have to end up in [Gr**e**nada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada) and not [Gr**a**nada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada) - a town and province in Spain.

After that I have to, again, sleep over as the flight is to late for me to catch the ferry to get me from St George's on Grenada to Hillsborough on Carriacou. There is a plane shuttle between the islands but I would be late for that as well (its also a little more pricier). I figure after a long-haul flight I would have been sick and tired of hearing the safety brief and the knee crunching legroom. After that I hope to be picked up at the airport to end at CAH.

That is the plan. Stay tuned :)
