This was the first time I have gone to a headlining stand-up comedy show. The one in the comedy store in London was similar in ways very very different. This was in a proper theatre and there was no intimidation or any kind of boo-ing coming from the crowd. In fact there was a fare bit of very well humoured picking of certain members of the crowd from Dara's side.

I have seen [Dara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_%C3%93_Briain) on many TV shows, primarily on [Mock the Week](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_the_Week). By the way, I hope to see his former colleague from that same show [Frankie Boyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Boyle), next month in Swansea. The show itself was great and the seat I had was very good, quite close to the stage, but not close enough to be picked on - or spat on: In some of Dara's exuberant verbal outburtsts there was some obvious salivary discharge being made and very visible from the angle I was seeing it from (sorry Dara :-).

As I am reading his [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dara_%C3%93_Briain.jpg) I see he is only 8 months older than me. I feel quite humble, but I do beat him in the hair quantity department ;-) At least something. As many will know he actually is a very tall fella and as he stands on the edge of the stage he looks even more imposing. You wouldn't want to be in a fight with him, he'd probably beat you in a second flat.

His tour has only just began and it will be going on all over the country. See [Dara's personal website](http://www.daraobriain.com/) for more info.
