My recent trip to Slovenia gave me the repeat opportunity to do some skiing again which I was looking forward of doing on the ski resort of Krvavec. I am proud to report no falls or injuries whatsoever.

The place was absolutely packed, probably due to the fact that it was in that weird time between Christmas and New Year and lots of people had the time off work. The other one was that the weather forecast was very good in the mountains. That was part of the problems with skiing as the snow got very wet and heavy very quickly. The highest ski slope Zvoh got closed at 1pm anyway. Luckily I only bought a four hour ticket so I avoided having to have to plough my way through most of the slopes.
