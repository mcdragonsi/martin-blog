![Sunset behind Tryfan](https://img.mcdowell.si/2011/11/sunset_behind_tryfan-1.jpg "Sunset behind Tryfan")

I returned to to Snowdonia in mid October 2011 to explore the northern third of the Snowdonia range, also known as the Carneddau. They are the most technically demanding part of the Snowdonia range in my opinion but you should not disregard them as there are some really stunning views seen on this range.

When I was returning back to the car park near Llyn Ogwen I was blessed with a spectacular sunset behind the Tryfan mountain. The shade the mountain was creating was moving so fast I had to constantly move to get the desired photo. Not the easiest thing as I could be ran over by speeding cars on the A5 road on the side of which I was standing at the time of taking the photos.
