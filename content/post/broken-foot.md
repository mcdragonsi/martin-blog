I have done a few things in my life and and a lot of them involving my feet: I've hiked for hundreds of miles round Pembrokeshire, jumped out of an airplane 146 times, hiked up Kilimanjaro and the worse injury I had was a sore heel.

But no, I have a lovely afternoon stroll on a gravel road and I go and break a foot. That's it, my first fractured bone in my life at 48. And not really doing anything.
