Not a very nice start to the day. Started raining early in the morning and so I had to pack a wet tent and everything that goes with it. The wetness just seems to impregnate everything else.

Hit the road at about 7am and it was still raining then but it did soon stop. Just as I thought everything was just find I noticed something dangling from one of the bags. I quickly pulled over just in case I was in immediate chance of sharing my belongings with the rest of drivers on the motorway. Just as I got of my seat a car pulled up in front of me and then started to reverse. Oooops - I'm in trouble, I thought. Perhaps an unmarked police vehicle. Well, it turns out it was just a concerned driver who saw me pull over and immediately stopped to see if I was in trouble.
And it happened again in Minnesota when I stopped at the side of a country road near the village of Brandon, MN.
People here are just so keen to help out. Doesn't feel so lonely after with so many people looking after you :-)

Driving on a motorcycle with an open-face helmet has already taken its toll - on my eyes. Similar to my many patients who get the same condition after they stick their heads out the car window :-)
Unfortunately I cannot self medicate myself and I am not intending to get out a mortgage just to be seen by a doctor.

Stopped over at the Minneapolis Harley Davidson shop to buy some proper eyewear.
