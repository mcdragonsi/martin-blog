## Saturday, October 5th

Didn't have much time to savour the moment. In the evening we had our certificates and our beers and warm meals and a shower. Up at stupid o'clock to get to the Kilimanjaro Int'l airport that was about 1.5-2 hours away. 

When we got there and when I tried to get into the airport the security guard started to say that my passport was fake. FAKE!! It must have been a bit of travel drowsiness and it being very very early in the morning but I just couldn't comprehend what was going n. After insisting a couple of times that my passport was forged he admitted he was just joking. ##%!!X@
