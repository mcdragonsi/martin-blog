It actually called [Foel Cwmcerwyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foel_Cwmcerwyn) and is the walk no. 20 in the [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Walking-Pembrokeshire-Circular-National-Cicerone/dp/1852844310). There hasn't been any proper rain for a couple of weeks so it looked promising. I had to abandon this walk weeks ago due to the fact that one big part of the walk was transformed into quite a substantial stream.

None of that this time, the sun was up, no sign of the before mentioned stream. The walk is actually quite a feat, lets just say I wasn't going tapdancing that evening. My Slovene genes were intrigued but will none-the-less live to climb another mountain.

Didn't take many photos as it turned a bit foggy once I reached the summit Foel Cwmcerwy.
