Not feeling very well in the morning of the last day, this cold has been getting the better of me and running around London does not help it getting any better. Drugging-up with anti-inflammatories not helped either.

First port of call was the [London eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye) I booked the previous day on-line. Looks amazing when standing underneath it and the views of London once you are right at the very top are stunning. Wasn't really sure how they get people on and off - I thought they had to keep on starting and stopping the whole wheel but in fact it just keeps on moving all the time at about 1 km/h and you have to be quick to get on and off. The whole trip takes about 30 minutes. There are two positions in each capsule - if you stand there you can get an automatic picture taken of you at the end of the ride.

Right next to the London eye is the very good London Aquarium. The smaller fish tanks are only a prelude to the absolutely amazing large tank - it is very enormous. You see it from different angles, from walking underneath it - or more like through a tunnel, then at the side of it higher up and even right on top of it with the sharks and like swimming beneath your feet.

After that was a quick jump to [Regent street](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.5108,-0.1387&spn=0.01,0.01&q=51.5108,-0.1387%20%28Regent%20Street%29&t=h) to visit the Apple store to buy some headphones for my [iPod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod). The show is very big and needles to say it was packed - I guess there will be a lot of their gadgets under the tree this Christmas.

If you are in [Southwark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark) and close to [Bermondsey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermondsey) street I would definitely advise to have a lunch at the [Village Deli](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=tanner+street&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Tanner+St,+London+SE1,+United+Kingdom&ll=51.500446,-0.081739&spn=0.000551,0.001043&t=h&z=20&layer=c&cbll=51.500525,-0.081774&panoid=8Lter3PmSs2VZ9lyY3hHAw&cbp=12,95.43,,0,13.39) at the corner with Tanner street. It was on the way from the London Bridge tube station and the apartment I was staying at. I tried their chicken wrap and it was delicious.
