![p1120002_smaller](https://img.mcdowell.si/2009/01/p1120002_smaller1-1-300x225.jpg)I had the opportunity to sample a great studio-grade professional foot pedal from a company called [Line6](http://line6.com/). The machine is called a [POD XT Live](http://line6.com/podxtlive/) and was lent to me for a few days by a friend. On the website the POD XT Live is described as an »_uncomplicated, gig-ready tone machine that's portable and adaptable to different real world stage and recording environments_«.

Well, it is truly impressive and quite complicated to a novice like myself. My first task given to me was to read through the manual which, I must say, is not exactly a pocket edition. OK, it's not [War and peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace) but it DOES have about 190 pages!! Luckily there is a Quick start guide for those who »don't need no stinking manual« :-)

It has loads of different connections which I won't even try to describe in fear of sounding stupid - you pros will know them anyway and if you don't, see the [Line 6 website](http://line6.com/podxtlive/). It does have standard output/input sockets, Variax socket and even a USB socket to connect the whole thing to a PC. Sorry all [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) users as the software is for [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) and Mac users only. Shame on Line 6, I just hope the [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/) will be able to run it successfuly.

Confirming the pro-esness of this machine are the artists that use it. There are: Garbage, U2's The Edge, Radiohead, Nine inch nails, Keane, Green day, Jamiroquai, Muse, Slipknot, Kaiser chiefs and many more.
