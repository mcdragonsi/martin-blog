Of course not literally, but it was [published today](http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/4311162.Plans_made_for_Harry_Potter_and_Robin_Hood_filming/) in the local newspaper that the [Freshwater West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_West) (the location of one of my recent trecks: [The difference is in the Angle](post.php?action=edit&post=1155)) will be used as a filming location for the upcoming movies [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows) and [Ridley Scott's Robin Hood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_(2010_film)) remake.

The debate is now mostly concerning whether the beach will still be opened to the public and when the road will be closed during the filming in May and June 2009. The biggest problem I see is that there isn't much parking available close to the beach anyway so I suppose that is why they will shut the road off.

See the gallery from the hike [here](https://mcdowell.si/about/gallery?album=Angle) and here are some photos taken of the beach...
