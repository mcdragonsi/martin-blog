[![Ruinair](https://mcdowell.si/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ruinair1-1-201x300.jpg)](http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/displayProductDetails.do?sku=6493407)According to my experience, yes. I tell all [Ryanair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair) visitors in advance that this here is my personal opinion and will not allow the publication of rude comments from anyone.

I had the misfortune of booking my flight today only to be confronted with an error just at the point you would least like it - after purchase.

A while ago I found a [blog post](http://www.jason-roe.com/blog/free-ryanair-free-flight-bug/) about a session problem with the Ryanair website here. OK, some bad responses from some Ryanair employees who basically did not apologize or acknowledge the problem. However here I am today using their website on this computer for the first time and just after confirming my credit card details get the message »Ryanair Session locked«. What does this mean? It did remind me of the [problem mentioned on Jason's blog](http://www.jason-roe.com/blog/free-ryanair-free-flight-bug/) as it involved problems with the sessions on the website transaction system.

I did get a confirmation by e-mail but I cannot verify my booking through the Ryanair website. OK, the natural thing would be to ask Ryanair about it. All they have for the UK is a [hugely overpriced phone number](http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/faqs.php?sect=CONTACT&div=int_sup) 0905 566 0000 at £1.00 per minute!!! Why would I pay for Ryanair's mistakes. So that made me a bit ticked off, hence this post.

Oh, yes, if Ryanair would like to contact me they can do so after paying me £5.00 for my troubles. And that goes for any possible comments for this post.
