[![evl-z2_031](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2009/01/evl-z2_0311-1.jpg)](http://www.cort.co.kr/english/products/common/view.asp?product_id=167)The day was good, the sun was up and the road was clear, well just to [Haverfordwest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverfordwest) golf club, after that I got stuck behind the never-ending queue of cars driving 40mph on a 60mph road :-) I'm not bitter. Really I am not.

![Gamlins store Cardiff](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2009/01/gamlins1-1-150x150.jpg)My final destination was [Cardiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff) and [Bristol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol) although the latter was more as an alternative as I could not find any good music shops there over the internet.

In Cardiff I visited [Cranes](http://www.cranesmusicstore.com/) and [Gamlins](http://www.gamlinsmusic.co.uk/). The first was a renowned music shop established in 1851 but I found it difficult to browse the guitars as many of them were high up on the wall and the price tags so small that they were illegible. Gamlins seemed to have a better collection and the guitars weren't stacked high because the ceiling just wasn't that high anyway and the price tags were clearly visible. After passing the very tempting Gibsons that mostly cost over a grand I settled-in to the more affordable ones. I had a go at playing three quite different guitars and after a thorough test decided on the [Cort EVL Z2](http://www.cort.co.kr/english/products/common/view.asp?product_id=167). True it has a more hard sound than the other two I tried but it was much nicer to play and that in the end is quite important. Also I hope that the harder sound will be adjustable with the amp and different type strings but the ease the [guitar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar) is played cannot be changed easily or at all - I have learnt that very hard lesson from my acoustic :-)
