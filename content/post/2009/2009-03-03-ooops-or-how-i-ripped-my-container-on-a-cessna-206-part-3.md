Ooops no more. I have received my container back this morning via [FedEx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx). The tracking itself proves why it sometimes makes sense to switch your courier service. As I mentioned in my previous post [here](wheres-my-container-825.html) and [here](ooops-or-how-i-ripped-my-container-on-a-cessna-206-2-816.html), I chose [DHL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHL) to send my container to the U.S. It has a good network here in the UK and since I sent it in November there is an even closer [service location](http://locator.dpst.dhl.com/Partners/DHL2/Html/Poi.aspx?&GeoFormatIn=3&GeoFormatDatabase=3&Locale=en-GB&Radius=1000000&View=5&Partner=DHL2&SecurityID=C6JTR7rbRcZ4MDDe3uKJbA%3d%3d&Country=GB&BC=DHLGB&LengthUnit=6&Town=haverfordwest&MasterBranchCodes=true#) right here in [Haverfordwest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverfordwest)'s [WH Smith](http://www.whsmithplc.co.uk) shop. But there was a huge delay in the dispatch location in the States delaying the shipment for quite an unreasonable time. FedEx took just 6 days!!!

The container was repaired free of charge which is a big plus for Aerodyne even though there seemed to be a manufacturing fault to which they conceded. At least they fixed the problem and sent the container back to me, again, free of charge.

But there is a problem which I won't follow-up on. There is a small discrepancy with the logo which was on the flap that had to be replaced.

The blue colour of the arrow pointing down is not the navy blue colour it was before.
