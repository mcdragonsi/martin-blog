Back here again, desperately trying to find an FS-1 coach to get my FS-1 license done.
Only did one jump today as I developed one very nasty headache and it seems this is one of the rare times I didn't bring any painkillers along.

Oh, what fun ;-)

Beside that the Friday night jumps will commence soon, preparations are under way as I speak (I mean write).
