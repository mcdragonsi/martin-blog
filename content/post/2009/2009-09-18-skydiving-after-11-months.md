After waiting for 11 months and practically giving up on the notion of jumping out of a plane for the foreseeable future. The given opportunity came last week, Friday off and a sunny forecast. Great weekend.

Managed 7 jumps the [Netheravon](http://www.netheravon.com/) DZ. Now all I am left to do is to get my FS1 licence as its needed in the UK for jumping in groups.

Didn't take any photos, was a bit worried would get nicked as the DZ is situated on an active military base (technically its an [airfield camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netheravon#Netheravon_airfield)).
