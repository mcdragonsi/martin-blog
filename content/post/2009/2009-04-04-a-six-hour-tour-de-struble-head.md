[![The Strumble Head lighthouse](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2009/04/strumble_head_lighthouse1-1.jpg)](https://mcdowell.si/about/gallery?album=StrumbleHead)


This was the longest of the walks in the [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Walking-Pembrokeshire-Circular-National-Cicerone/dp/1852844310/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1237062996&sr=11-1) and a walk not to be reckoned with. It is long and by the end you just really want to see that lighthouse in the distance.

The authors say in the beginning of the walk »Although the longest of the walks in this book, there is nothing difficult about its undertaking« - Yeah right, either they (both authors) came home from this walk and their egos were to big to admit the agonizing pain in their muscles or they had themselves a post-hike [LSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) trip.

However there is apossibility I brought the toughness of this trip on myself as I completely forgot to bring along something to drink ending-up being rather dehydrated by the end of the hike. There are no refreshments to be bought on the way, not even in the part that runs through [Goodwick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwick) :-(

A word of warning, in the first part of the walk as you leave the coastal path to start-up Garn Fawr it is a bit confusing as to where to turn. Do NOT continue on the paved lane. This will only end in tears - tears due to the realization you have to go back as you have gone the wrong way. There path signs is missing, well, I say missing. I found it hidden in the grass on the ground.

I was also quite surprised to find an inscribed stone commemorating the [last invasion of Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_invasion_of_Britain) - by the French none-the-less in 1897 at Carregwastad Point. What were they doing here, we all know where France is, I presume they shot their navigator.
