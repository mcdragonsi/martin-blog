I am convinced you everyone will see the huge difference in the views you see on the north side of the peninsula, compared to the south - while on the north side you see the beautiful town of Angle, but then as you move further along you are met with the view of all the petroleum and gas industries in the area with their huge piers and tall chimneys. And as you continue to the south part of the peninsula all that you can see is the vast ocean.

The walk started on a very sunny day with hardly a cloud in the sky. As it was [Easter Sunday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter) I was better off arriving early as the crowds of tourists were soon to follow. Luckily only the beach parking area and [Freshwater West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_West) beach were busy, the rest of the path not so much as people opted not move more than 500 metres from their cars.

OK, so I don't forget to mention this. It is about a reference in the hiking book to a  "leafy lane" - word of warning - the trees above are covered with nests and you would probably want to avoid the poo projectiles coming from the heavens. I also advise changing the path a little bit in the town of Angle by continuing pass the church on the right and turning right on a path through the playground, which, on the other side, continues towards an old guard tower.

As you continue on the coastal path you get the opportunity to have good look of the new [LNG South Hook](http://www.southhooklng.co.uk/) gas terminal - it recently had its first shipment of gas from [Qatar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar) and I heard the tanker that was docked in front of the terminal was spectacular.

The more exhausting part of the route is from West Angle beach to Freshwater West, there are many valleys to climb down and just as many to climb up from. A good idea is to pace yourself, especially on the ascent.

Have a look at [the photo gallery](https://mcdowell.si/about/gallery?album=Angle) but the photos, as usual, do not do the »live« views justice.
