This one the walk no 27 taken from the [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Walking-Pembrokeshire-Circular-National-Cicerone/dp/1852844310) and is a bit of a deviation from the books theme - it being that there are 41 circular walks in [Pembrokeshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire). Well this walk is still in Pembrokeshire but it is not at all circular. However the authors can be forgiven for this as it is a very nice easy walk with some nice views, especially at the main Slebech estate (see [their website](http://www.slebech.co.uk/) for more details. If you are a birdwatcher then this walk should definitely not be missed. In quite a few places along the road you can reach the [Eastern Cleddau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Cleddau) and gaze upon the views of the river and the bird population that occupy it.

See the complete [photo gallery here](https://mcdowell.si/about/gallery?album=BlackpoolMillAndTheOldSlebechChurch).

There is also quite a bit of history related to the Slebech estate and the church. It dates from the 12th century A.D. when the grounds were owned by the [Knights of St. John of Jerusalem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller) who "have their roots" in the [first crusade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade). Cool.
