![Looking down towards Cwm mawr](https://img.mcdowell.si/2009/04/p3290007_smaller1-1.jpg "Looking down towards Cwm mawr")

What a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend a March Sunday. In fact it was so nice I wish the hike would have lasted a bit longer. Instead I took the opportunity to sit and enjoy the sunshine on the wooden bench by the Sychbant car park were this walk starts and ends.

The [walk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Walking-Pembrokeshire-Circular-National-Cicerone/dp/1852844310/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1237062996&sr=11-1) (no. 39: Mynydd Caregog and Carn Ingli) starts off with a nice steep hill and then should continue in a [conifer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta) forest. As this has now been cut down the walk continues in something more resembling a wasteland. Conifers are not a native tree in this area and due to the concervationalism of today a more proper forest is being planted. However I haven't seen any signs of the this today.

Once you leave this so-called forest the view changes into a more familiar [Preseli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preseli_Pembrokeshire) hillside on the Carningli Common. The Carn Edward stone group did not really draw my intention so I skipped it and rather choose the hilltop on my left - Carn Briw - no doubt being, again, a decision influenced by my Slovene origins.

If you are walking in the area the ruins of the Carn Ingli fort (the translation of Carn Ingli is the "Hill of angels") is a definite must-see, if not for looking at it, at least by climbing on top of it and enjoying the views. I attempted to bring the view to you but not getting the live experience does give the place its justice.

The book then states you should circle the fort on its north side and then find a path towards the hill on the eastern side. This is actually quite tricky but I was either lucky or my navigation experiences proved to be the basis of some good instincts. I though I completely missed those two poles and the tramway that were supposed to be somewhere on the descent. Instead I ended-up right on top of them - spot on!

The walk then continues towards some farms and ends up in the Cwm gwaun valley. The "second" part of the walk continues on a delightful path on the opposite side of the valley and there was absolutely nobody on it but myself. You will find a stunning forrest scenery, abandoned farms and even an abandoned mill.

I would definitely recommend this trek to anyone and the muddiness factor was quite low.
