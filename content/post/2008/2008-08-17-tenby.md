I have put it off for a long time but a sightee-er to [Tenby](http://www.visittenby.co.uk/) was well due. The town of Tenby lies on the [south Pembrokeshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pembrokeshire) coast and if leaving from [Haverfordwest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverfordwest) can take the road across the Cledau bridge or you can, by saving the 75p bridge toll and, depriving the [Pembrokeshire County Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire_County_Council) :-), go through Canaston Bridge.

I had the privilege to see it on a beautiful sunny July day in 2008. There are a few parking spots close to town but the multi-storey car park is your best bet. See [map here](http://www.visittenby.co.uk/map). I have been to a few British seaside towns but this beats them all with it delightful charm and lack off cheesy entertainment that so often can be found in the stereotypical British seaside town. As I was born in [Portsmouth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth) I feel free to [slag it off](http://flickr.com/photos/13073759@N04/2615767647) as an example to my point.

I wanted to take the opportunity and see [Caldey island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldey_Island), which is just off the coast from Tenby but at is was a Sunday and the island is de facto run by monks it was closed. All you could take is sightseeing boat trips round the island. I was on the seal safari trip. Besides getting really up close to some curious seals I had the chance to get a first seat view of the [Tenby lifeboat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenby_lifeboat) being pulled back up into the lifeboat house. For those who are not familiar with the procedure of launching the [RNLI](http://www.rnli.org.uk/) lifeboats in Tenby is that they keep the boat completely closed-up in the lifeboat and when an emergency demands the service of the RNLI lifeboat that is quickly released and the boat slides down the slipway and straight into the water.
