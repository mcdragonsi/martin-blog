[![](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2008/08/Aerodyne_Icon_Martin_01-1-150x150.jpg)](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2008/08/Aerodyne_Icon_Martin_01.jpg)I have now managed to send off the container to the manufacturer [Aerodyne](http://www.flyaerodyne.com/) in [Florida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida). I have just driven back from [Swansea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea) where I send off the container through a [DHL ServicePoint location](http://www.dhlservicepoint.co.uk/) in the [Parc Tawe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_Tawe) [Staples](http://www.staples.co.uk/) shop. Great service, if you ask me, as you don't have to pay a high price to have your packed shipped and you also choose what boy its going to be sent in - the price of shipment depends on the size of the box, but with a upper weight limit. I sent in a large box which has an upper weight limit of 5kg - even though my container weighed only 3.5 kg. There are currently about 750 ServicePoint locations in the UK.

When the lady in [Staples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staples_Inc.) was helping me pack I kept on thinking that I am forgetting to post something, but I could not put my finger on exactly what. Considering I still had an disassembled container this morning I had to move fast so I unintentionally forgot to send the Aerodyne form that should be in the DHL package.

What can I say, ooops for the second time?
