The Slovene edition of Playboy issued a great article in rememberence of our dear pilot Som and our Fata (to know more about this please read the following articles: article 1: [»Fata« and »Som« have left us](https://mcdowell.si/2008/01/our-fata-is-gone.html); article 2: [A great tragedy](https://mcdowell.si/2008/01/great-tragedy.html)).
The Playboy article was written by [Sabina Mali](http://www.sabina-mali.com/), [Miss Hawaiian Tropic 2007](http://www.misshawaiiantropic.com/) and is, unfortunately for you English speakers, only written in Slovene. Perhaps an English translation will be available in the future - at least the video is worth watching- see our late Som and Fata in action.

There is also a video available that shows the good ol' days of the Fata boogies.
