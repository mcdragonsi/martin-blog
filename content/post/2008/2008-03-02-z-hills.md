I am writing these lines many many years later in 2021 when I redesigned my website and relaised I never entered any info about the Z-Hills dropzone called [Skydive City](https://www.skydivecity.com/).

We have departed our lovely huse near Deland and headed our own separate ways. Some of us met tup again in a lovely DZ called Z-Hills, located just outside the town of [Zephyrhills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyrhills,_Florida). A maze of small huts and wooden gangways. A lovely atomosphere and I kinda wished we stayed here longer. 
We met up with another Slovenian here who has been in the US for longer but I cannot remember his name. One thing we did bring for him was a can of Slovenian beer [Laško](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C5%A1ko_Brewery).

I even managed to get another jump in. I am pretty sure the plane we used was a [Twin Otter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-6_Twin_Otter).
