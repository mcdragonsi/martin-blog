I have tried to visit this place before but the last time got a bit disappointed as there was the standard [parking fee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking). Today was a very good time to see the place, sunny and not a lot of people on it. Oh yes, and the parking was free. By the way, I am all for conservation and good old cash goes a long way in conservation but ripping local of so that they can use the local nature is just wrong. The place sees a lot of tourists but the rest of [Pembrokeshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire)-ians live here and want to enjoy the surroundings so why are the locals charges just as tourists are.

In any case, [Marloes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marloes) Sands is definately not to be missed if you visit Pembrokeshire. Different from lonf sandy beaches like [Pendine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendine), [Newgale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgale%2C_Pembrokeshire) or [Whitesands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesands) there is lots of interesting tectonics that make Marloes Sands very uniquie to the point of being eerie. I kept on expecting dinosaurs to come charging at me round the corner.
