My recent visit to the motherland gave me the opportunity for yet another [skydiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting) session, I joined my instructor and mentor Aleš Debeljak from the Paranoia skydiving school.

All went well and on the third jump of the second day just as I exited the [Cessna 206](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_206) I apparently managed to hook my rig on the side of the door which resulted in a nasty tear in my container on the reserve parachute flap. I am suspecting poor stitching but will have to send the whole thing to [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida) to be fixed.

Here are photos of the my sad-looking Aerodyne [Icon Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_Sport) container:
