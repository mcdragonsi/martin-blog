Started off while it was still dark. Plan A was going to ski on Krvavec. No plan B at that time. Just as we left Cerklje there was a suspicious hold-up in the traffic which turned out to be due to the great number of cars - all heading for the same ski resort. My friend and I parked just soon after Cerklje , where the buses usually park. That meantÂ  were were at least a few kilometres aways from the valley cable station. This didn't sound good and quite surprising as it was a Tuesday and still a working day.

![Vogel - the view](https://img.mcdowell.si/2008/12/pc230016_smaller1-1-150x150.jpg)We had to come up with a plan B double time or faced having to return home. Plan B came to be the Vogel ski resort which turned out to be a great idea. It took us about 45 minutes to get there and once we found a parking found no queue to go onto the cable lift.

However once we reached the top cable station we found out how right we were to choose this place. The views of the valley below and the surrounding mountains were stunning and there was also plenty of snow to enjoy - 260 cm (thats 8 and a half feet for my friends back in Wales :-)
