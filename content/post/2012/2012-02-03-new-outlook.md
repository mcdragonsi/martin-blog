Not written here for a while so I will be brief:



 	
  * Today was the last day at The Fenton Veterinary Practice - my employer for the last 5 years.

 	
  * Starting my own business as a locum veterinary surgeon.

 	
  * I incorporated my own limited company Pet Doc Martin

 	
  * Created a new website [PetDocMartin.co.uk](http://petdocmartin.co.uk/)

 	
  * Created a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/PetDocMartin), [LinkedIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/company/petdocmartin), [Twitter page](http://twitter.com/PetDocMartin) and [VetSurgeon page](http://www.vetsurgeon.org/wikis/veterinary-locums/martin-mcdowell-small-animal-locum-vet.aspx)

 	
  * My first contract will take e to London. I will probably write more about it on the Pet Doc Martin website
