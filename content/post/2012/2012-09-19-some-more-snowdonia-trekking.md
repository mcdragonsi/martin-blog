Not to repeat myself to many times but I went on a great hiking trip round Snowdonia. Got up way to early and still by the time I came to Nant Gwynant I was still very much in need of sleep. Besides that it was still pouring with rain but there were prospects of sunshine later. So I I did something I haven't so far: crawled in the back of my car, got myself comfortable, opened the windows a little bit and went to sleep. It certainly did the trick as when I woke up I felt great and the sun was up as well :-D

So my trek started just west of lake Gwynant and the YHA hostel. At the campsite I turned left to continue on the old road and then onto a path to Pen-y-pas. There I took the Pyg track to Snowdon and then the Watkins path on the other side back to the valley. took me about 6 hours to complete.
