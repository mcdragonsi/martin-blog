OK, sounds like a flashy title, but I did notice that the city of Nottingham was missing from Google Maps in any of the zoom views I chose.

I tried reporting a problem a while ago and recently received the following reply:

In any case it seems to be fixed now as [Nottingham](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=nottingham&hl=en&sll=52.925463,-1.211243&sspn=0.846097,1.63147&hnear=Nottingham,+United+Kingdom&t=m&z=11) appears where it should be. I now expect to be inundated by messages of gratitude from the citizens of Nottingham, however I feel I should not hold my breath for very long. ;-)

I was surprised to learn that the city of Nottingham is twinned with my home town of Ljubljana, but Ljubljana does [not publicly acknowledge that fact](http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/twin_cities_association_-memberships/). I have contacted the officials in the Ljubljana municipality but I am still waiting for them to get back to me.
