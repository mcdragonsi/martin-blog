[![Lancashire dirt storm](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2013/04/dirt_storm_17_Apr_2013-1.jpg)](https://dwlcvfkt1l4wn.cloudfront.net/2013/04/dirt_storm_17_Apr_2013.jpg)

This was definitely a first. Not only have I ever seen this meteorological phenomenon, I was never expecting to see it in the UK - the country known for its wet climate.

I was working in a small village in Lancashire but lived on the coast and on my way home I saw these strange dark clouds on the horizon. As I got closer I realised it was clouds of soil and dirt that were being picked up by the strong gusts of wind. Quite a few times the visibility on the road went to just a few metres and I had to turn on my lights and my rear fog lights. Very eerie feeling.
