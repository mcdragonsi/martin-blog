[![TP-Link TL-WR702N](https://mcdowell.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tp_link_TL-WR702N-1-294x300.jpg)](https://mcdowell.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tp_link_TL-WR702N.jpg)I don't usually write reviews here but this little gadget I have recently laid my hands on deserves it without any hesitation.
My work makes me travel a lot and I stay in places that don't have wifi access. Last year I bought a very capable and versatile Cisco/Linksys router E4200 but the problem is it is rather bulky. Not really made easy to travel around with.
But recently, completely by chance, I came across this little fella from TP-Link with the technical name [TL-WR702N](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006PYGWG6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B006PYGWG6&linkCode=as2&tag=marmcdsblo-21).

Really easy to work with. The back of the little box tells you on which IP address to find it on and then you go through the security settings. In about 5-10 minutes I was off. All you need to do it plug it into a LAN (RJ45) network socket like the ones you will find at the back of routers and into the power supply and that is it. The power cord is actually a USB cable so it will also get power if you plug it into your computer's USB socket.

The best is left for last. You can pick one up from Amazon UK for a very tempting Â£16.49
