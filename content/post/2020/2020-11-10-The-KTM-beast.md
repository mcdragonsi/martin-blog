I finally decided to replace my Honda NC750x DCT.
The Honda was a great bike, very easy to use, never stalled due to its DCT gearbox but it was very underpowered. It was a bit of a job trying to keep up with my fellow IAM riders out on our Sunday rides.
Plus it didn't help seeing this video from [Yammie Noob about the top 7 dorkiest bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8pu2CkT20). My Honda made the no 1 spot. :(

Anyway, changed to a completely different beats. The new bike is the **KTM 1290 Super Adventure S** with 160 bhp, manual trnsmission and a hell of an attitude. 

Listen it roar
