There are two public routes on and off the island. The Osprey ferry and the SVG flight. Now it seems to be an established fact that the ferry is a much more adventurous route meaning it is often a nausea inducing experience even for the more seasoned sea travellers. Anecdotally the trip to Carriacou is usually worse than the trip back. I managed to keep my stomach content down but it was touch and go for about half an hour.

As I mentioned in one of my [previous posts](https://mcdowell.si/volunteering-for-the-worldwide-veterinary-service-on-the-island-of-carriacou-2906.html) the island is relatively small, only 3 by 7 miles and with 8,000 inhabitants. There is very little tourism which is great if you want to experience an unspoilt and "original" Caribbean island but so so good for the locals who often struggle to make a living. The big cruise ships can't even tie-in (or whatever the correct term is) at the island - as the name Carriacou actually means - the island surrounded by reefs. While I was there there was one big cruiser nearby but it had to anchor about a kilometre out from Hillsborough.

I found most people on the island very very friendly and hospitable and I hope to be back there in the future, enjoying their great island and helping out their four-legged critters at the same time.
