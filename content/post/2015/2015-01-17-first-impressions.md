Writing this at least a couple of days into my stay. The passport control people nearly didn't let me in the country as they seem to pretend they didn't know about Carriacou animal hospital and to top it off the donated medical supplies got seized by customs. With the great effort from Penny in Grenada we managed to get them back the following day which meant I missed the morning ferry to Carriacou.
