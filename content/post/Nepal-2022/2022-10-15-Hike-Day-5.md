lead: "Chomrong to Dovan" # Lead text
draft: false
summary: The plan was for a 1h steep descent and then cross the river vie bridge. Then steep uphill and stopping in Sinwa and later Bamboo for lunch. Ending the day in Dovan. Word of warning. Had some korean style shin ramyen and they turned out to be VERY spicy hot. From then it would be about 2.5h to Sinwa.

The plan: 1h steep descent and then cross the river vie bridge. Then steep uphill and stopping in Sinwa and later Bamboo for lunch. Ending the day in Dovan. Word of warning. Had some korean style shin ramyen and they turned out to be VERY spicy hot. 
From then it would be about 2.5h to Sinwa.
On the way back we will be basically going back down this valley and we will sleep in Bamboo where this time we only had lunch. 

Dovan is a small village situated in a narrow gorge with a stunning view towards the north and south. Don't remember much about the palce but I do remember looking into the night sky and the Fishtail peak was still partially lit by the sun and you could see thousands of stars. Absolutely breathtaking.

Mid descent after leaving te lodge in Chomrong we came upon this great little shop. It was actually huge compared to other placed on the trail. Most of us stocked up on snacks. I bought some really nice peanut cookies. They were quite tough and crunchy and I loved them.
