To my relief I was starting to feel better in the morning. See my post from [Trek: Day 11 of 11]({{< relref "2022-10-21-Hike-Day-11.md" >}} "Trek: Day 11 of 11") on what happened the day before. 

Popping paracetamol down my throat every few hours did probably help as well. 

Got a cappuccino and a croissant from the local cafe called am:pm. After that went on a short walk but ever minding not to move far away from the hotel. Just in case I got worse. Which I luckily didn't. 

Later on got back to the hotel, enjoyed a bit of the swimming pool, went for some lunch and did some shopping. Proper touristy stuff. I was a little surprised how many cafes they had. I think they know what the westerners really like. 

Unfortunately I missed the big evening meal they all had. Made it up by going again the next day. The day after most of us left for Kathmandu via an internal Buddha Air flight on a 14-year old ATR 72-500 (9N-ANI, registered Dec 2007) from the old Pokhara airport.
