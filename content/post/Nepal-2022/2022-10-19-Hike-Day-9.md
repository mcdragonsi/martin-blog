Uneventful hike. We all just wanted to get down as soon as possible. 
Stayed at a place called Jhinu Danda which is near an intersection of three valleys. 
The one thing we were looking forward to see was the Jhinu Danda hot springs. 
Intrigued what this is going to be like, longing for some method to relax our aching muscles we headed downhill in our flipflops. Soon realising the path was a) to long and b) to steep for that kind of footwear. After a while we got to the ticket office which was basically a few wonky boards nailed together. We naively thought the springs were just round the corner. Oh noooo. We went down, and down, and down further on an uneven forest trail. After what felt like an eternity we finally ended up at the springs which had 4 separate small pools next to the river. There we some changing facilities but were quite basic, completely dark and a but dirty so I decided to just change outside. 

We were staying in Guring cottage in Jhinu Danda.

I'm not going to liw but laying in the warm water was oh so lovely. Not sure if it was the trip down, even less the trip up. Which, by the way, we did in complete darkness and we didn't have torches with us. Luckily some of the porters that joined us had their phones with them so we used their torches.
As I didn't take my phone with me I didn't take nay photos. There was an elderly guy there, probably Nepalese that seemed to meticulously film random people at the pool. Very creepy. But 0 shits given at that time.

Once we got back was the standard dinner and off to bed.
