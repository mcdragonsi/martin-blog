summary: Felt much more positive this morning. The sun was out again and the plan was to descend about 300 metres for 2 hours, then ascend for half an hour and continue with "Nepali flat" for an hour. Then would have lunch at Ghurjung Lodge and Restaurant in Ghurjung and then another 3h undulating hike until we reached Chomrong and the International Guest House at about 15:30.

Felt much more positive this morning. The sun was out again and the plan was to descend about 300 metres for 2 hours, then ascend for half an hour and continue with "Nepali flat" for an hour. Then would have lunch at Ghurjung Lodge and Restaurant in Ghurjung and then another 3h undulating hike until we reached Chomrong and the International Guest House at about 15:30.

After the usual mad rush to get to the shower, for which I was again late, we had some food and planned for the next day. We also had a briefing on the altitude sickness and the use of Diamox (acetazolamide).
Sleeping was a challenge up the mountains in general. First it was the west to east jetlag which is much worse than the other way. Then after a day's hiking my feet and legs struggled to settle. Kept fidgeting for hours. However using Diamox made things a bit more interesting as I had the slight tingling of your fingers and toes. It also caused some wild dreams and nightmares. I think these started in Chomrong. But I really couldn't sleep so I joined some of the hikers who were enjoying the night sky and some beers.

We did stop at a place called Mountain Discovery Lodge in Chuile near Chandruk. Not for lunch but for the scenery, the place itself was beautiful as you can see from the photos below. Also the guides gave as an explanation fo teh cultures and religions prominent in the Nepal. An emphasis on Buddhism. Also on the meaning of the multi-coloured flags that you see everywhere in Nepal.
