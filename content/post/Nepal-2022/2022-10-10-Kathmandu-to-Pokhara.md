This day was following our revised trekking plan. Instead of completing the Annapurna Circuit Trek we were now going to Annapurna Base Camp (ABC).

So for the ACT we would have to take a bus to Besisahar. Instead we took the bus to Pokhara. There is a flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara and knowing what the road between the two cities is like I would have gladly chosen the bloody plane. Don't get me wrong. It WAS an experience in itself. First just trying to get out of Kathmandu and then ending on the twisty bumpy roads above Naubise. The word bumpy would be the main adjective I would use for this ride. At least we had our own bus so we could regulate our own stops. I thought I have not seen roads worse than in Herefordshire but the road from Kathmandu to Pokhara either has large potholes, or the tarmac was completely missing. I remember we stopped for lunch at one point had several loo breaks and we arrived in Pokhara about 8h later after leaving the capital.

We arrived in Pokhara exhausted after being bounced round our bus for hours on end. The hotel looked quite nice and it was a stone's throw away from Pokhara lake. We had a short briefing about the next day and what we will be doing. The hotel we stayed in would also be the hotel we would ultimately return to after the trek.
