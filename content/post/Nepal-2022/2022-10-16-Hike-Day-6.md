lead: "Dovan to MBC" # Lead text
draft: false
summary: This part for most was the toughest day of them all. It was the biggest ascent we did the whole trip at 1,210 metres. It was also quite a long trek at nearly 9 kilometers. We started early as always and headed up the gorge. Crossed several streams and bridges. As the gorge is quite narrow we encountered much narrower paths and we crossed several landslides. This part of the trail also doesn't allow for horses to be used so everything gets carried by humans. Even helicopters aren't allowed to transport supplies. Only humans and their equipment.

This part for most was the toughest day of them all. It was the biggest ascent we did the whole trip at 1,210 metres. It was also quite a long trek at nearly 9 kilometers. We started early as always and headed up the gorge. Crossed several streams and bridges. As the gorge is quite narrow we encountered much narrower paths and we crossed several landslides. This part of the trail also doesn't allow for horses to be used so everything gets carried by humans. Even helicopters aren't allowed to transport supplies. Only humans and their equipment. 

The next stop was Himalaya. After that another 5h to Deurali where we had lunch. And that was only lunchtime. Took us another 3 hours to get to todays finish at MBC (Machhapuchhare Base Camp). 
I think the higher we went the more spectacular the views of the mountains got. Yes, we saw some lovely mountain views from afar at Poon Hill but now these giants were coming up very close and personal. 

I think we all had an early night but unfortunately it was not meant to be. This dog kept barking in the distance and he just wouldn't stop. I somehow managed to fall asleep only to awake again for a look break but couldn't go back to sleep as the dog was still bloody barking. This was now about 1am or 2 am so hours since we went to bed. I am sure it was bloody bothering others (which int he morning I found out it did).
So had to put my vet hat on and go check the dog out in case it was in distress even though the pitch of the bark didn't really support that.

Headed down from the lodge towards the valley and found this dog happily laying on the ground and just barking into thin air. Literally. There was f*** all there. Got really pissed off then and gave him a telling off in Slovenian so no one overheard it and wouldn't appreciate my swearing at the mut. He was fine and even walked towards me. Anyway, that didn't completely topped him from barking as I could here some faint barking carrying on after I got back to my sleeping bag. But eventually even he shut up.
