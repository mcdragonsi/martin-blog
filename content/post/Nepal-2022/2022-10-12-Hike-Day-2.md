Woke up to a glorious sunshine morning. Started a relatively easy second day at about 7am. 
Had lunch in Lali Gurans guest house in Nangethati about mid-day. Arrived in Ghorepani at about 15:30.  

In case you didn't know, Ghorepani means "horse water" in Nepalese. They you go. Now you do.  

The place we stayed in, the Sunny Hotel, was huge. The whole village was huge. We had a room with a large panoramic window. 
This is where I found out how slow I was on this trip to get myself to the hot shower queue. There was usually a charge, about 200 NPR but it was SOOO worth it at the end of each day hiking. Something I think most of us looked forward to at the end of the hike. 

Many places we hiked past had dogs roaming about. Difficult to say whether they were owned or not but they did not seem aggressive. In any case avoided petting them as it didn't look they were used to that kind of interaction with humans.

Evening similar to previous night. After dinner we had a briefing for the next day which was big one. 

In more senses than one.
