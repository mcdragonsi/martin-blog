summary: We had an early start. Got our gear together. Put the bits in the red duffel bag that would end up being carried by the porters. Its was a short(ish) drive to Nayapul where we officially started the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek. We followed gravel roads for an hour or so and then at one pint ended on proper hiking trails.

This was the first time we would experience the traditional Himalayan / Nepalese teahouse accommodation. It was basic but in a way it way quite comfy. Nowhere else did we get en suite shower and bathroom. However as there was no power there was no light, the shower was icy cold and as per usually the toilets are VERY basic.
