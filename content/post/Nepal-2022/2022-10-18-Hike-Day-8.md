>Length: 13.8 km  
>Ascent: 0 m  
>Descent: 1,800 m  

The night was mostly uneventful except we had a new issue with the dogs. What's with the dogs up there. There was one that insisted on sleeping on our doormat. He seemed quite comfortable but he was essentially blocking our room. Also we wouldn't want to tread in parts of him and hurting im attempting to stepping over him. So I managed to get inside and nudged him with my foot. He have a bit of a disapproving growl and then left. We moved the doormat a few feet and later that night found him sleeping it peacefully. There was actually another dog nearby that was partially blocking the way to the loos. But you could carefully walk around him. 

The trek today was going to be long but in the sense of distance and getting to a lower altitude. We had an extra early start as during the night one hiker in our team got a bt of altitude sickness. Nothing severe but just meant he needed to skip breakfast and head down the hill asap. Which the hiker did together with a guide. We all met up again at MBC and continued the hike further down the valley together. When we got low enough the hiker's symptoms improved and was almost back to normal. 

We passed through Deurali (3,210 m) and I think we just had a quick stop there. We stopped for lunch in Himalaya (2,850). This is the place where they have a proper coffee machine. Most if us din't pass the opportunity to have a bit more posher coffee. 

We lost a tonne of altitude this day, 1,800 metres and finishing today's trek at Bamboo (Bamboo guest house). Bamboo is a location where we had lunch 3 days ago at day 5 of the trek. I completely botched my task getting to the hot shower as I was absolutely last to get to it. By the time I got out, changed and ready everyone else was already on the Ghorka beers. I decided to be more of an elderly supervisor than a participant. Given my 50th birthday was 2 days away I guessed somebody needs to keep the kids in check (ha ha). Full disclosure, there were 3 guys in the group older than me.
One of the most stunning things about Bamboo is that it has a waterfall right above it. Was difficult to photograph from the guest house so have no stunning photos of this to show you.
