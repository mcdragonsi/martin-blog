Yesterday was spent visiting the local temple in Kathmandu called Swayambhu or Monkey temple in English. Today I decided to venture out further. A fried recommended I see this ancient town with wonderful architecture. The place is called Bhaktapur and it is about 20-30 min out of Kathmandu. I ordered a proper taxi this time. Even with Kathmandu temperatures at about 25Â°C it was pretty chilly on the bike the previous day when it was warmer. 

Cost me about 850 NPR to get there and I dropped off what seems like the edge of the city centre. All of a sudden I get besieged by a couple of guys trying to aggressively get guide work. And then another guy making me go in an office to pay a fee. Really didn't like the situation I was in and needed to make sure I wasn't being scammed. Looks like tourists are required to pay a fee to get into Bhaktapur. I payed but I politely declined the guides. I do actually prefer to explore places by my own. Not that I would not want to contribute to the locals. But I'll do it my own way. The pestering of the guides did not end, when I came to the main entrance to the old city it got much worse.
