Feeling better after the midnights tunnel session, still having problems with some of the techniques but my instructor Alja≈æ says there are visible improvements. I hope so as I sometimes feel like a sack of potatoes in a tornado when I'm in the tunnel.  
Today marks the end of the tunnel sessions for most of us as our group will be moving out of the hotel and heading up to Deland, FL.  
Oh, a word of warning for anyone buying the 0044 sim card for the U.S. I still have not managed to make it work. I have now contacted 0044 instead of Jolt, who offers the service in the U.S., and I am awaiting if there can be anything done.
