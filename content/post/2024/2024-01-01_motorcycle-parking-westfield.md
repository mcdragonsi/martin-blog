## Westfield London (Shepherds Bush)
Every so often I do need to get to London but I have been warned by other motorcycle riders to be VERY careful when riding in the big smoke. They can quite easily pinch your bike when you are on it. Now a few years ago I found parking at the Westfield shopping centre car park very handy and relatively cheap when using a car. But did you know you could park your motorcycle there as well? Securely. Under a roof. And best of all … **FREE**. 

The details are accurate at the time of writing in January 2024. Please forgive me if anything is incorrect or might have changed. You can find any updates and current news on Westfield’s website.

Their website states that they are at **Car Park A Level -1** and **Car Park B Level -3** and can be best accessed directly from the **A40** and **A3220**. They also state that there are *“over 75 motorcycle lockers available”*.

To do is bring your own padlock to secure your bike at the locker.

The top boy took a little persuasion to get in there but once you learned how to "pivot" correctly (yes, Ross Geller, I remember) it goes in fine.

Bring your own padlocks but make them different size as they won't fit if they are to big

## Westfield Stratford City
The situation at the Stratford City Westfield if very VERY different.
You cannot access the normal carpark on motorcycle, unless you pay I guess. They have two designated areas just outside Carpak entrance B. The pne on the left is small but kinda more suitable for larger motorcycles but not secure. The one on the right is much smaller and really designed for scooters and also not secure. Neither have any barriers.

![The much smaller parking on the right of the entrance](https://img.mcdowell.si/2024/2024-01-01_motorcycle-parking-westfield/westfield-stratford-2.jpg "This was also not very busy when I was there but would be very difficult to manoeuvre a larger bike if it was busy")

These two photos was taken mid November 2023 on a Wednesday evening. Just so you know.
